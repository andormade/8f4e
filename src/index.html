		<p>
			8f4e is stack-oriented programming language with a semi-visual interface specifically designed for
			generating and processing real-time audio signals. While its primary environment is the WebAssembly Virtual
			Machine and AudioWorklet, we plan to develop compatibility with microcontroller platforms by providing
			appropriate glue code in the future.

		<h2>Why the stack-oriented design?</h2>
		<p>The WebAssembly Virtual Machine uses a stack machine architecture, which offers several advantages for
			cross-platform compatibility. Stack machines have a simpler instruction set and fewer hardware dependencies
			than register-based machines, making them easier to port to different platforms.</p>
		<p>A programming language that is designed with a stack-oriented approach can perform operations on the stack
			in a manner that is both efficient and natural, with instructions that can be easily mapped to those of the
			stack machine. Therefore, a programming language with a stack-oriented design is a natural fit for the
			WebAssembly Virtual Machine.</p>
		<h2>What does semi-visual mean?</h2>
		<p>Visual programming languages use graphical elements, such as icons, symbols, and flowcharts, to represent
			programming concepts and logic, instead of traditional text-based code. 8f4e combines these graphical
			elements with text-based code.</p>
		<h2>Why is this better than exporting a Max/Msp algorithm to JavaScript?</h2>
		<p>Although Max/Masp may be easier to learn, 8f4e offers superior flexibility, efficiency, and the ability to
			test audio algorithms in the browser with live-edit capability thanks to its fast compilation time.</p>
