# 8f4e

8f4e is a semi-visual, stack-oriented programming language for real-time signal generation and processing. ðŸ“¡ It runs on the WebAssembly Virtual Machine.
## Why the stack-oriented design?

The WebAssembly Virtual Machine uses a stack machine architecture, which offers several advantages for cross-platform compatibility. Stack machines have a simpler instruction set and fewer hardware dependencies than register-based machines, making them easier to port to different platforms.

A programming language that is designed with a stack-oriented approach can perform operations on the stack in a manner that is both efficient and natural, with instructions that can be easily mapped to those of the stack machine. Therefore, a programming language with a stack-oriented design is a natural fit for the WebAssembly Virtual Machine.

tl;dr: Using a stack-oriented programming language makes it possible to create more efficient software for the WebAssembly Virtual Machine.

## What does semi-visual mean?

Visual programming languages use graphical elements, such as icons, symbols, and flowcharts, to represent programming concepts and logic, instead of traditional text-based code. 8f4e combines these graphical elements with text-based code.
